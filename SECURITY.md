# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently only the latest version of NuGet packages will receive vulnerability updates.

## Supported .NET versions

TestableHttpClient is build as a netstandard2.0 library, so theoretically it can work on every .NET version that support netstandard2.0.
However, only the following versions are being actively tested and thus supported:

- .NET Core 2.1
- .NET Core 3.1

These versions are supported as long as Microsoft supports them, we do our best to test and support newer versions as soon as possible.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Vulnerabilities in the libraries can be reported via an issue on GitHub. A PR to fix the issue is always welcome.
